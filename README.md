##Description
This Java Image Editor is a console-based application that allows you to perform various image editing operations on an input image. The operations include:

-Converting an image to grayscale
-Increasing or decreasing brightness
-Rotating the image
-Cropping the image
-Blurring the image
-Rotating the image by 90 degrees
The code uses Java AWT, Java IO, and JavaX ImageIO libraries for image manipulation and file input/output.

##Dependencies
The following dependencies are required to run the code:

-Java AWT (java.awt.image.BufferedImage, java.awt.Color)
-Java IO (java.io.File, java.io.IOException)
-Java Util (java.util.Scanner)
-JavaX ImageIO (javax.imageio.ImageIO)

##Usage
1.Clone or download the repository to your local machine.

1.Ensure you have Java installed on your system.

1.Place your input image (e.g., "tiger.jpg") in the same directory as the Java file.

1.Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the project directory.

1.Compile and run the code.

1.Follow the on-screen menu to select and perform the desired image editing operation.

##Operations
Print Pixels: Display the RGB values of each pixel in the input image.

Convert to Gray Scale: Convert the input image to grayscale.

Increase Brightness: Adjust the brightness of the image by a specified percentage.

Rotate Image: Rotate the input image by 90 degrees.

Crop Image: Crop the input image to half its original size.
